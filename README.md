## Manager for HTML5 Presentations - Rust

## How does it work?

First of all create a _Markdown_ file with the content of your presentation,
assign a name that identifies it and save it in `/static/slides`.

You can use *reveal.js* themes or create your own and put it in `/static/css/theme`.

Finally, you need to add the following information in `/static/slides.json`, which
is the file that contains the list of your presentations.

- `id` - A number to assign and identify each of your presentations
- `file` - The name of the Markdown file
- `title` - The title of your presentation
- `description` - A short description of your presentations' content
- `style` - The name of the theme file
